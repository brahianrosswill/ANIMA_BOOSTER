This package allows you to achieve a **total acceleration of 3.5× to 5.0×** compared to the default Anima workflow in ComfyUI, with no noticeable loss in visual quality.

## ⚡ Key Features

* **Integrated JIT Compilation (`torch.compile`):** Safe, one-click compilation of DiT blocks built directly into the loaders. Runs on the stable `inductor` backend without CUDA Graphs, ensuring 100% stability and a speed boost of **20% to 40%**.
* **SageAttention:** Built-in support for ultra-fast 8-bit attention tailored for DiT models, significantly accelerating computations while reducing memory consumption.
* **Adaptive TeaCache:** Intelligent latent state caching. Dynamically adjusts the caching threshold: automatically lowering it in early steps to preserve geometry, and raising it in later steps for maximum acceleration.
* **BSS Premium UI:** An integrated, high-contrast dark theme for the package's nodes. Features a fully redesigned full-width slider control, adaptive visibility for inactive preset inputs, and complete suppression of intrusive tooltips for a distraction-free experience.

## 🧩 `BSS/AnimaBooster` Node List

All nodes are registered under the `BSS/AnimaBooster` category:

1. 📥 **Anima Booster Loader (BSS)** (class `AnimaBoosterLoader`)
   - Loads the Anima DiT model in the optimized fp16 format.
   - **SageAttention**: Automatically applies accelerated 8-bit attention if installed in the system. If unavailable, it seamlessly falls back to built-in PyTorch SDPA.
   - **Torch Compile**: An integrated toggle for safe JIT compilation of individual transformer blocks.
2. 🎛️ **Anima TeaCache (BSS)** (class `AnimaTeaCache`)
   - Implements adaptive latent state caching based on denoising steps (TeaCache).
   - Automatically calculates the timestep scale for all sampler types (including SDE).
3. 🖼️ **Anima Latent Image (BSS)** (class `AnimaLatentImage`)
   - A utility for generating empty latents with automatic size alignment to the Anima DiT patch grid (2x2), preventing tensor dimension mismatch errors. Provides predefined aspect ratio presets.

## 📈 Adaptive TeaCache Threshold

Unlike standard TeaCache implementations with a fixed threshold, the **BSS** version uses a **dynamic adaptive threshold** that evolves during the denoising process:
- **In early steps** (high noise, image structure formation), the threshold is automatically lowered to ensure maximum rendering precision and geometric accuracy.
- **In later steps** (details have stabilized, micro-texturing takes place), the threshold is raised, allowing up to 80% of block computations to be safely skipped without quality loss.

---

## 📋 Recommended Workflow

To achieve the best results, connect the nodes in the following sequence:

```
[ Anima Booster Loader (BSS) ] ── (Enable sage_attention: auto and torch_compile: True)
             ↓ (MODEL)
[ Anima TeaCache (BSS) ] (Recommended: threshold: 0.15, adaptive: ON)
             ↓ (MODEL)
        [ KSampler ]
```

## 🛠️ Installation & Dependencies on Windows

All resource-heavy optimization libraries (**SageAttention** and JIT **Triton**) are **entirely optional**. The package is designed with *Graceful Degradation* in mind: if the libraries are not installed, the nodes will automatically disable patches or compile features, transitioning seamlessly to standard PyTorch mechanisms and guaranteeing crash-free execution in ComfyUI.

> [!IMPORTANT]
> **Triton is required for both SageAttention and JIT Compilation (`torch.compile`)**!
> If you plan to enable `torch_compile` (which yields up to a 40% speed boost) or use SageAttention on Windows, you **must** install `triton-windows`. Without Triton, `torch.compile` will be safely disabled with a warning in the console to avoid crashes.

### 📦 Installing Triton and SageAttention on Windows (for Portable Builds)

Portable ComfyUI builds (which use an isolated `python_embeded` environment on Python 3.12 or 3.13) do not have C++ compilation tools (MSVC / Build Tools) installed. As a result, the standard `pip install sageattention` command will fail with a compilation error.

To install it successfully, use precompiled binary packages (`.whl` wheels):

1. Open a command prompt (CMD or PowerShell) in your main ComfyUI folder.
2. Install Triton for Windows:
   ```bash
   .\python_embeded\python.exe -m pip install triton-windows
   ```
3. Download the precompiled `.whl` file for SageAttention that matches your Python version (e.g., `cp312` or `cp313`) and CUDA version (e.g., `cu124` / `cu128`):
   - Precompiled builds can be found in the releases of this repository: **[sdbds/SageAttention-for-windows](https://github.com/sdbds/SageAttention-for-windows)**.
   - Precompiled wheels are also published in the project: **[wildminder/AI-windows-whl](https://github.com/wildminder/AI-windows-whl)**.
4. Install the downloaded file into the portable environment:
   ```bash
   .\python_embeded\python.exe -m pip install <path_to_downloaded_file.whl>
   ```

## 🧑‍💻 Technical Implementation Details for Developers

- **Model Base**: Anima DiT is based on the `MiniTrainDIT` architecture with the `LLMAdapter` wrapper.
- **SageAttention Integration Point**: The patch is applied via the standard `transformer_options["optimized_attention_override"]` parameter dictionary.
- **Torch Compile Integration Point**: Invokes the built-in `set_torch_compile_wrapper` function from `comfy_api.torch_helpers` at the level of individual transformer blocks (ensuring LoRA compatibility and reducing compilation overhead).
- **Isolation**: All graph and weight modifications are performed strictly on a cloned copy of the model (`model.clone()`). This prevents conflicts and leaves the original model in the ComfyUI cache untouched.
